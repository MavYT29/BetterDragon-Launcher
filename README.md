ENCOUNTERING "FindFirstFileW failed" ERROR? FIX IT NOW ðŸ’£

Getting a "FindFirstFileW failed: error [00000002]" message? Your antivirus might be blocking the file. Here's the fix:

#Temporarily Disable Antivirus:

1. Find your antivirus icon (usually bottom-right of your screen).
2. Right-click and choose to disable "Real-time Protection," "Virus Shield," or "Auto-Protect" (or similar) for a short time (15 mins - 1 hour).

#Redownload the File:

1. Go back to the website where you originally downloaded it.
2. Download it again.

#Immediately Re-Enable Antivirus!

1. Turn your antivirus back ON as soon as the download finishes. Don't browse the internet while it's off!
2. Right-click the downloaded file and choose "Scan for viruses" (if it doesn't scan automatically).

#Try Running the Program:

 1. If the scan is clean, it should work now.

                                                                                                           Still Not Working?

1. Add an exception: Tell your antivirus to ignore this specific file (check your antivirus's instructions on how to do this).
2. Contact the software developer: They might know about the issue and have a solution.

Keep your antivirus on for safety, only disable it briefly when needed!
